# RCF 

Route Control Function (RCF) is a BGP policy language available for arista
platforms. 

# installation

pretty much like any other vim plugin, clone this into your
`~/.vim/pack/default/start` directory and go to town.

# suckage

much. this is pretty slapdash and was just to give my eyes something a little
more forgiving to look at when writing RCF policy.  someone should really do
right by this.
